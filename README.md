# SBSPS-Challenge-5324-Analytics-Tool-For-Ecommerce-businesses
In this project we have created a Dashboard using IBM Cognos Analytics. We have tried to show the following things so that the retailer can find out statistics such as,
  1. Region that accounts for a greater number of orders.
  2. Frequency distribution of quantity ordered.
  3. Percentage sales by different product categories.
  4. Profitable products or their sub products in the last few years.
  5. Products that incurred losses.
  6. Product type that was ordered greater times.
  7. Yearly sales for various states.
  8. Forecasting future sales according to shipping date.
  9. Trend in profit/sales over time (years/months/quarters).
